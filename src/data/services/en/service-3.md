## What is a Statutory Auditor?
Statutory audit is an independent and regulated profession that contributes to the quality and transparency of financial and accounting information issued by entities such as S.A.s, SARLs, SASs, or associations. The primary mission of a **Statutory Auditor** (CAC) is to certify a company's annual accounts by conducting a legal audit. The procedure for this audit is defined by law and in accordance with current standards.


## Objective of the Statutory Auditor
As part of a financial audit, the statutory auditor aims to certify the **fairness, regularity, and true and fair view** of a company's annual accounts. The statutory auditor is also obligated to report any irregularities observed during their examination.

A statutory auditor is a financial professional, and more broadly, a business expert, capable of assisting you with the certification of your accounts or your internal control and operational procedures.


## Roles of the Statutory Audit
The statutory audit has two fundamental roles:
1.  **Certifying financial statements** (Balance sheet, income statement, notes to the financial statements, corporate income tax follow-up);
2.  **Monitoring the entity's sustainability**, particularly through strategic watch, where they exercise their mission with the potential obligation to trigger an alert procedure.

The missions carried out by the statutory auditor are based on a legal obligation. They intervene in private companies and structures within the public, trade union, and associative sectors.


## Why Use a Statutory Auditor?
The statutory auditor assumes responsibility for account certification. Their audit is subject to principles of independence and ethics. It is a **service of public interest**, not a contractual mission guided by private law. Their mission specifically includes:

* Expressing an opinion on the **regularity, fairness, and true and fair view** of the annual and consolidated accounts;
* Verifying the fairness and consistency of the financial information provided to the general assembly with the annual accounts;
* Disclosing any criminal acts they become aware of to the Public Prosecutor;
* Issuing attestations at the entity's request, when applicable;
* Preventing difficulties through the alert procedure in certain entities.

Entities can also engage a statutory auditor for services other than the certification of annual accounts. These interventions are called **directly related services** (DDL), such as:

* Performing an acquisition audit before a potential transaction;
* Giving an opinion on provisional accounts;
* Attesting to interim accounts before a loan application;
* Providing attestations for obtaining subsidies;
* Facilitating hiring aid and enabling the development of aid for apprentices.

The statutory auditor can also perform contributions in kind or transformation audits.

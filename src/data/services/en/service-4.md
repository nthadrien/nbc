# Contributions Audit


## What is a Contributions Auditor?
**Contributions** refer to sums of money (**cash contributions**) or tangible or intangible assets (**in-kind contributions**) that partners contribute to their company to form the share capital.

Contributions can be made when the company is formed or during a capital increase. In exchange for their contribution, partners receive social shares or stocks representing a fraction of the share capital.

As in-kind contributions can constitute all or part of a company's share capital, they must be valued. To preserve equality among current and future partners, this valuation is carried out by an independent expert external to the company, known as the **contributions auditor**.


## Why Engage a Contributions Auditor?
The contributions auditor is a financial professional selected from the list of statutory auditors.

The contributions auditor's mission is to assess, under their responsibility, the value of assets contributed to a company during its formation or a capital increase. If applicable, they also assess any special benefits stipulated during the formation or capital increase. The auditor then submits a valuation report, which is filed with the trade and companies register. At the time of formation, this report is appended to the founding articles of association.

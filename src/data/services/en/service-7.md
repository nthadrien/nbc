## What is an Inventory?

**Inventory** involves creating an exhaustive list of the items appearing on the balance sheet, i.e., what the company owns, and valuing them at their current worth. When we speak of inventory, we often mean the inventory of **stocks** and **fixed assets**.
There are generally two inventory methods: **perpetual inventory**, which involves recording the movements of stock inflows and outflows as they occur, and **physical inventory**, which involves counting the stock at least once a year.

## Why Request an Inventory?

A company must carry out an inventory annually to control the existence and value of the assets and liabilities on its balance sheet. A company must prepare annual accounts at the close of the fiscal year based on accounting records and the inventory.

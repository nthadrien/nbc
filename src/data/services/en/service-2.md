## The Definition of Accounting, Financial, and Organizational Audit
An accounting, financial, and organizational audit is a process of methodical examination of a company's financial statements, accounting procedures, internal controls, and organizational structure.

Its purpose is to control the regularity of the company's accounting statements. It also serves to conduct a more comprehensive assessment of management quality.

The accounting and financial audit is one of the common procedures designed to verify the validity of a company's accounting. The audit is most often carried out by an external auditor or a statutory auditor. The audit can lead to a certification of the financial statements of the audited company. This is a major credibility asset with its business partners or shareholders.

## What is an Organizational Audit?

An organizational audit is an analysis of a company's internal organization. Its objective is to highlight its strengths and weaknesses across all its dimensions. It focuses particularly on the distribution of work among employees, the flow of information, the role of hierarchy, compliance with procedures and regulations, etc.

## How to Conduct an Audit?
Expert auditors are provided with a mandate or a letter of engagement from the business owner. They proceed with an in-depth, line-by-line verification of all documents useful for understanding the accounts. This includes:

- The income statement, which details all of the company's revenues and expenses;
- The balance sheet, including the inventory of the company's assets domestically and abroad, as well as its liabilities;
- The accounting annex, containing various statements designed to facilitate the understanding of the income statement and balance sheet;
- Articles of association;
- Procedure manual;
- Internal regulations and other documents necessary for understanding the company's financial and organizational status.

The evaluation work performed and the points addressed by the auditor can cover many aspects related to the company's activity such as:
- Verification of compliance with the various accounting obligations imposed on the company;
- Control of financial risks;
- Consistency of the accounting organization adopted internally by the business owner, and the quality of training for specialized employees;
- Definition of the financial objectives pursued by the company;
- Search for any irregularities in working documents, especially after the close of the accounting period;
- Verification of certain accounting points or statements by soliciting the company's usual business partners. This process, known as circularization, allows for cross-referencing information with that of third-party companies;
- Control of internal procedures, software, and other aspects necessary for the proper functioning of the company.

The conclusion of the audit results in the delivery of a detailed report to the mission's principal. This report may include a complete validation of the audited structure's accounting organization. It may also express reservations regarding certain malfunctions. Finally, it may include a very unfavorable opinion if serious deficiencies are found.

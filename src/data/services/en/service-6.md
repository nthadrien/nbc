## What is Certification?

**Certification** is the activity by which the Statutory Auditor or the Chartered Accountant, as the case may be, expresses an opinion indicating that the summary financial statements are regular, fair, and present a true and fair view of the results of operations for the past fiscal year, as well as the financial position and assets of the entity at the end of that fiscal year.

Only individuals registered with the Order of Chartered Accountants are authorized to certify financial statements, including the chartered accountant and the statutory auditor.

The mission of certifying financial statements is incompatible with that of accounting and/or tax assistance and can only be performed by a Chartered Accountant independent of the entity preparing the financial statements.

## Why Request Certification of Your Accounts?

The certification of accounts ensures that a company's annual accounts are **regular** and **fair**.

By **regular**, we mean accounting that is maintained regularly, up-to-date, and in compliance with the valuation and presentation rules required by law.

By **fair**, it refers to accounting prepared on the principle of loyalty and good faith. The figures presented must accurately reflect the situation of the company in question.

The work performed to certify the accounts is therefore a verification and authentication of accounts to reassure stakeholders about the company's financial health.
